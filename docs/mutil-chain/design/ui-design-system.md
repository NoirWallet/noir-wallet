# Noir Wallet UI Design Baseline

This reference applies to the extension popup, dApp approval window, side panel, and full-tab hardware flows. The production [theme](../../../packages/extension/src/popup/index.css) and reusable [UI components](../../../packages/extension/src/popup/components/ui/) are the source of truth. A Figma screen may guide layout and visual hierarchy, but its old dimensions, fonts, or hard-coded colors do not override the production system.

## Foundations

| Role       | Production token or value | Use                                                                    |
| ---------- | ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Background | `background`, `#12121c`   | Wallet pages                                                           |
| Foreground | `foreground`, `#ffffff`   | Primary text                                                           |
| Primary    | `primary`, `#00d18a`      | One filled primary action per screen, focus, selected borders, success |
| Card       | `card`, `#282832`         | Items and selections                                                   |
| Popover    | `popover`, `#202029`      | Dialogs and layered surfaces                                           |
| Muted      | `muted`, `#7e8a93`        | Secondary text                                                         |
| Border     | White at 10% opacity      | Dividers and default item borders                                      |
| Input      | White at 15% opacity      | Default input borders                                                  |
| Warning    | `#ffc201`                 | Recoverable risk requiring attention                                   |
| Danger     | `#ff4444`                 | Errors and destructive actions                                         |

Use semantic theme classes such as `bg-primary`, `text-muted`, and `bg-card`. Do not add screen-local copies of these colors. A selected item uses a subtle primary border or tint and a radio/check marker; it does not compete with the filled primary button. Selection must not depend on color alone.

Product UI uses **Jost** at weights 400-700. Addresses, hashes, and precise machine-readable values use **DM Mono**. The bundled font files and licenses live under [public/fonts](../../../packages/extension/public/fonts/). Do not add an old Figma font to reproduce a legacy mockup. Typical hierarchy is an 18px page title, 16px navigation title, 14-16px body, 13-14px field label, and 12px caption; match the component and available space.

Use a 4px spacing scale, favoring 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, and 32px. The content column has 20px horizontal padding; the 56px header has 16px horizontal padding. The footer has 20px horizontal padding, 20px bottom padding, and must remain visible. Reuse the [Button](../../../packages/extension/src/popup/components/ui/button.tsx) and [PageHeader](../../../packages/extension/src/popup/components/common/PageHeader.tsx) implementations for actual size, radius, focus, loading, and disabled behavior.

## Viewports And Layout

| Surface                | Verification viewport                                       |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Popup                  | 375 x 600                                                   |
| dApp approval          | 375 x 632                                                   |
| Full-tab hardware flow | Full browser tab with a centered content column up to 440px |
| Side panel             | Available panel width and height                            |

Pages use a header, a scrollable content region with `min-h-0` where needed, and a footer that does not shrink over content. Avoid horizontal scrolling and unnecessary vertical scrolling at the target viewport. Long addresses, hashes, names, and balances must wrap or truncate without covering adjacent labels; retain a way to inspect the full value.

## Components And Content

- Use one filled primary action for the current task. Secondary actions use the existing outline, ghost, or link variants. Loading and disabled states keep control dimensions stable.
- Use existing input and password components for default, focus, error, and disabled states. Recovery-phrase input must show word position and invalid words without logging or transmitting the phrase.
- Use compact segmented selections for two or three short mutually exclusive options; use a vertical list when labels or supporting details need more room. Show the selected state directly.
- Use the existing Dialog for high-impact confirmation. Show actionable consequences for deletion, reset, permission expansion, and high-risk signing. Never display raw RPC/WASM errors, secrets, or full sensitive values as explanatory copy.
- Use [ChainIcon](../../../packages/extension/src/popup/components/common/ChainIcon.tsx) for network identity and [TokenIcon](../../../packages/extension/src/popup/components/tokens/TokenIcon.tsx) for assets. Chain icon URLs and aliases belong in the shared icon mapping; do not build a third-party favicon URL from a dApp origin.
- General account, asset, Send/Receive, Activity, and dApp layouts should remain consistent across chains. Show only enabled chains with complete capabilities. Keep network identity alongside assets when identical symbols can refer to different chains.
- Mainnet is the default and need not be repeated on routine cards. Keep explicit labels for Testnet and other non-mainnet environments, and for any choice where network changes behavior.
- Copy should help users complete the task, understand current data, or choose the next action. Put business limits into controls, field validation, confirmation, and failure feedback instead of standing rule text.

## Figma To Code

Inspect a target Figma screen's structure and screenshot before implementing it. Keep the original design intact and place experimental changes in a `CODEX REVIEW` section. Map designs to the production tokens, Jost/DM Mono, and the target 375px viewport; the older 344 x 588 canvas is not a production acceptance size.

Reuse components under [popup/components](../../../packages/extension/src/popup/components/) and use `cn()` for conditional classes. Compare a rendered screenshot at the target viewport, checking clipping, overlap, footer visibility, text density, and selection states. Run the relevant real extension flow when popup, storage, MV3 lifecycle, or approval behavior changes.

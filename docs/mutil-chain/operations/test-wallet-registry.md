# Test Wallet Registry

Reusable test wallets are registered here. Tests may create temporary, unfunded wallets, but any wallet reused across runs needs a named slot. Never place a funded wallet's mnemonic, password, or private key in Git-tracked files. Keep each secret in a separate absolute-path file outside Git tracking with mode `0600`; the local registry holds only paths and non-secret metadata.

## Public, Permanently Unfunded Vectors

These vectors are public and may be swept automatically. Never request or store Mainnet or Testnet assets in them.

The slot name records purpose, not availability. Revalidate the referenced file, network, derivation, and usable balance before a live run. Public transaction IDs, previous balances, and addresses cannot recover a missing credential and do not prove a local slot is configured.

## Local Configuration

1. Copy `packages/extension/.env.test-wallets.example` to `packages/extension/.env.test-wallets.local`.
2. Apply mode `0600` to the registry and each secret file. Secret file paths must be absolute and must not be symbolic links.
3. Put only file paths, birthday heights, account slots, and test amounts in the local registry. Never put mnemonics, passwords, private keys, `NOIR_TESTNET_BROADCAST=1`, `NOIR_TESTNET_PROVISION_TARGET`, or any other broadcast-enabling setting there.
4. Run `pnpm --filter @noir-wallet/extension test:wallets:check`. It reports `ready`, `not configured`, or a redacted error for each slot without printing paths, addresses, or secrets.

Playwright reads `.env.test-wallets.local` automatically; explicit command-line variables take precedence. Ordinary tests work when that file is absent. An existing file with invalid permissions, variables, or format fails validation.

The EVM fixture is a `0600` JSON file with `schemaVersion: 1`, `network: "sepolia"`, the derived `address`, a 24-word `mnemonic`, and an 8-64 character `password`. The Bitcoin fixture uses the same fields with `network: "bitcoin-testnet3"`; its address must be the mnemonic's Account 0 BIP-84 `tb1q` address, and its mnemonic may contain 12 or 24 words. The Solana/NEAR fixture uses `schemaVersion: 1`, `networks: ["solana-devnet", "near-testnet"]`, `solanaAddress`, `solanaRecipientAddress`, `nearAccountId`, `mnemonic`, and `password`; use the exact format shown in the example environment file. Each Zcash fixture is a `0600` text file containing exactly one 24-word mnemonic line, with its birthday height in the corresponding `_BLOCK` registry field.

`NOIR_TESTNET_MNEMONIC_FILE` and `NOIR_TESTNET_BIRTHDAY_HEIGHT` may override the selected Zcash source for one run. Keep the override file outside Git tracking and subject to the same permission checks.

## Live-Test Boundaries

- `test:evm:testnet:live` performs a real EVM broadcast when its fixture is configured. Inspect the test and authorize the transaction before running it.
- Bitcoin live tests require `NOIR_BITCOIN_TESTNET_BROADCAST=1` on that command line. The default funded flow sends Max back to the same controlled BIP-84 address and spends the Testnet fee. The BIP-44/49/84 sequence additionally requires `NOIR_BITCOIN_LEGACY_INTEROP=1` on the same command line; it broadcasts multiple transactions and waits for intermediate confirmations.
- Solana/NEAR live tests require `NOIR_SOLANA_NEAR_TESTNET_BROADCAST=1` on that command line. `NOIR_SOLANA_NEAR_LIVE_CHAIN=solana|near` limits a run to one chain. Solana sends a small amount from Account 0 to the fixture's controlled Account 1; NEAR sends to itself.
- Zcash funded flows require `NOIR_TESTNET_FUNDING_SOURCE=1` on the command line. Broadcasting additionally requires `NOIR_TESTNET_BROADCAST=1`.
- Broadcast switches must never be stored in `.env.test-wallets.local` or other persistent configuration. Public vectors are for deterministic, offline, or simulated-RPC tests only; use a private slot for faucet or real-balance checks.
- Screenshots, traces, console output, and failure messages must not contain local paths, mnemonics, passwords, private keys, raw vaults, or signing session data.
